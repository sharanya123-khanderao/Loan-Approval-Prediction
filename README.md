The advent of technology has increased the demand for loans, resulting in a higher volume of loan requests in the banking sector which is a challenge to banks as they must carefully assess each applicant's eligibility, and the process is time-consuming.
This project uses machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of selecting eligible candidates for loan approval. By implementing these techniques, banks can expedite the loan approval process, benefitting their staff and applicants.
